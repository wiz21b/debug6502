# A small 6502 debugger

Load your compiled code with your source (actually a "report") file and then execute step by step.
The debugger will automatically (ie lousy heuristics) detect interesting memory places and
show them as bytes or words.

Right now, only ACME 0.96 source code has been tested. It'll probably works with other versions.
